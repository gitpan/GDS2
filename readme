This is GDS2, a module for quickly creating programs to read, 
write, and manipulate GDS2 (GDSII) stream files.

Originally developed on big endian machines, it should 
now work on little endian machines too.

Currently the I/O of the module is not too speedy. Processing
a 10Mg file on my 800MhzPIII takes close to 3 minutes.
