Revision history for Perl extension GDS2.

Makefile.PL created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-X -n GDS2
		
1.0   Originally developed on big endian machines, I still have some
      work to do on the write methods for little endian machines.

1.1   Should be set for little endian machines. Starting to look
      for speed improvements.

1.1.1 Started adding tests. Needed to make a change to little-endian
      record read.

1.2.0 Added a bunch of constants. Starting to look at speed-ups. Write
      year out as years since 1900 since Cadence pipo has problems with
	  ISO type date (2001 v.s. 101)
