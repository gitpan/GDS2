This is GDS2, a module for quickly creating programs to read, 
write, and manipulate GDS2 (GDSII) stream files.

You can get a significant (~30%) speedup by using the 
compiled C additions to the module (Build option).

Send feedback/suggestions to
Schumack@cpan.org

use cpansign -v to check file integrity

GDS2 should be able to handle any size gdsii file but
is generally considered too slow for anything larger 
than a few megabytes in size. If your files are are
closer to the gigabyte range you should check out the 
gdt programs at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gds2/
