This is GDS2, a module for quickly creating programs to read, 
write, and manipulate GDS2 (GDSII) stream files.

Originally developed on big endian machines, it now works 
on little endian machines also.

Currently the module is not too speedy but has been improved
over time. The speed of the module is still too slow to use on
chip level GDS2 files. 

I originally planned on releasing version 2.01 of the module 
which would make use of Inline and C to speed things up a bit
but alas my preliminary version 2.01 has shown little or no 
improvement in speed ... I may have to wait for Perl 6 and try again.
